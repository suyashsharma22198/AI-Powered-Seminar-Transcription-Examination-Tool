 Hi guys, my name is Somil Shah and in this video I'm going to be teaching you how to write a proper good IEEE paper So most of the people do not know how to write a technical paper This is the reason I decided to make a video on this So what is the technical format? What should be the font size? Everything is very important. So let's begin without wasting much of time So first of all to download the template of IEEE You have to go to Google and simply type in IEEE paper formats Slash, so space word All right, so the first one right here you can download it The link would be also there in the description section below so you can you know even download that so yeah So we would be waiting until the download gets complete and yeah You can see the paper I mean the word file right here So this is the basic template which tells you what to do how to do basically what should be the font size So here is the paper title there should be subtitled the author's name Then the abstract abstract should not be more than thousand words, baby and Keywords then you should have an introduction within heading if you're inserting figures So this is a basic format this format would be there in the description section below in the In on my youtube channel, so I'm gonna show you my technical paper right here All right, so my paper is about internet of things IoT based cloud data logging system using things being taught So so the author's name is Somil Shah and Shalindra Jada up So you can have a look at it my abstract. It's about thousand words. So abstract should not be more than thousand words You should have a key words. You should have an introduction So this is how it looks like then I have a basic description about what What hardware I'm using you should describe your hardware in detail about and also the specification What is the minimum temperature in maximum temperature range repeatability Productibility etc etc basically so after you're done with that So you can have a look at it whenever you insert figures in your picture Make sure that you you know give proper labeling to the figure that that means figure one pin diagram of DHT 11 temperature Naming is very important. So make sure you do that. That should be very Proper basically. So you can have a look at it It should be times new Roman and the phone should be 10. So this is very important when you are publishing some papers in our Repu-read journals after that comes The reference section now what is reference reference may means that these are the list of papers who Which I was referring to and you can have a look at it. See one two three four the number and after doing that If you observe my paper carefully, I'm just gonna zoom in a little bit. So you you see basically right here I've mentioned Four year that means I have taken this from the reference paper number four So that is this paper. This is very important because you should you should know how to write a paper So whatever data I mean materially or taking from any other paper or anybody's paper make sure you add that in the reference section and Also, you have to define that. I mean which reference paper that is number four or three or etc After that comes acknowledgement it should be not more than you can you know give acknowledgement about three to four lines That is more than enough a short suite reference Then the result should be there the code should be there in your IEEE paper and This is the basic format of your IEEE paper basically. So you can just have a look at it the title Title should be in times new Roman the heading should be 18 Authors name should be in times new Roman heading should be 11 and abstract and everything should be there in times new Roman and 10 10 or 9 is the basic size and abstract you have to bold the abstract part and All the important keywords section you have to bold it that said I hope you guys find this video a little bit useful If so give a like subscribe to me The link to download the itripely template that is this one So this paper the link would be there in the description. So you can you know simply edit you don't need to prepare the entire paper. Let's say Tripoli So you can quickly edit in this world file this world file was there in the description you can download it So that's it for now if you guys like my project videos and ideas do give a like subscribe to me if you have any questions List your question in the comment section and I would try my best to answer all your questions. That's it
